# hoolock

hoolock is a Pytorch-based, GPU-friendly StackLSTM implementation that makes it much easier and faster to build a StackLSTM parser. To give you an idea, for Penn Treebank, the training takes about 30 minutes with batch size 256 on a single GTX-1080Ti GPU.

### Naming

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoolock_gibbon), hoolock gibbons are generally found in eastern Bangladesh, Northeast India and Southwest China. Benefiting from their special brachiating skills, they can travel up to 35mph between the **trees**, making them the **fastest** and **most agile** of all tree-dwelling, non-flying mammals.

Because of shrinking habitat and hunting, most species of the hoolock genus have been classified by IUCN as "Vulnerable" or "Endangered".
